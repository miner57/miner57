- 👋 Hi, I’m @miner57

- 👀 I’m interested in actually accomplishing something on one of my computers some day.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to teach my main work computer how to recognize 5ghz wifi band from my hot spot on my new phone.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on degoogle, and unmicroshaft the world

- 📫 How to reach me e mail me any time. It might take a while to answer so please be patient. I have many questionswhich I ask in a story about what has been happening to me
over the past 25 years online. Most of what I write about my experiences online very unbelievable, but I share tem nonetheless. If anybody who reads what I write 
has had the same things happen please share your conclusions about these "ghost in the machine" experiences.
